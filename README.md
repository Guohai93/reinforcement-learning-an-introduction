# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Python implementation for Sutton & Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) 

> **Declare**: Most of codes are modified from [ShangtongZhang](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction), but rewrite the codes to make it easy to understand. I not only write the codes for **figures**, but also complete some **exercises** in the book.
